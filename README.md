# Math Teacher AI 🧮🤖


## Empowering Math Literacy Through AI-Assisted Learning

Math Teacher AI is an innovative application designed to bridge the gap between complex mathematical equations and intuitive understanding. By leveraging the power of AI and image recognition, this tool transforms intimidating math problems into engaging, interactive learning experiences.


## 🌟 Key Features

- **Image-to-Explanation:** Upload an image of any math equation, and watch as the AI breaks it down into easily digestible concepts.
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Engage in a conversation with the AI to deepen your understanding of mathematical principles.
- **LaTeX Support:** Mathematical notations are rendered beautifully using LaTeX, ensuring clarity and precision.
- **Personalized Learning:** The AI adapts its explanations based on your questions, providing a tailored educational experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saisurya96/math-teacher-ai.git
   cd math-teacher-ai
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
